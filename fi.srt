1
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:26,337
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

2
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:28,099
<i>Hell of an engagement ring.</i>

3
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,541
Unfortunately,
that ring belongs to me.

4
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,423
What I need,
only Noma can get me.

5
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,664
If I get you these green cards,

6
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:35,466
will you please
stall Noma out for me?

7
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:36,908
Noma said that Lombardi
was her ex.

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,509
This is her kid.

9
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,791
This is her Achilles' heel.

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,272
What the fuck is this?

11
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:44,115
You're not being arrested
for drug dealing, Effie.

12
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:46,077
<i>That's the bitch</i>
<i>that tried to kill me.</i>

13
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,398
This is a RICO.

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,640
You're looking at 20 years
federal time.

15
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:52,123
Weston Holdings
is a fucking Ponzi scheme.

16
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:54,045
That means my fucking
trust fund money is gone.

17
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,486
Yeah, and the Tejadas'.

18
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:57,008
You gave our money
to a bunch of motherfuckers.

19
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,770
Now I gotta go
get it the fuck back.

20
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:01,532
Yeah, I'm into
this honesty thing.

21
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:03,054
I'm just not into losing.

22
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,697
That's funny,
because you're losing me.

23
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:07,698
<i>What's that?</i>

24
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,020
A letter from my lawyer.

25
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:10,742
Saxe says Tariq set me up
to get arrested.

26
00:01:10,784 --> 00:01:12,744
We better not do anything
till we know for sure.

27
00:01:12,786 --> 00:01:13,985
<i>Why would Papi's prints</i>

28
00:01:14,027 --> 00:01:15,306
<i>be at the scene</i>
<i>of Zeke's murder?</i>

29
00:01:15,348 --> 00:01:17,108
It was your mother.

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,470
<i>She wanted Lorenzo dead.</i>

31
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,112
I'm so done
with your lying bullshit!

32
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:22,954
I would have did the same thing
for any of you!

33
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,595
If anybody should be dead,
it's yo' ass.

34
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:25,596
- I should be dead?
<i>- Yes!</i>

35
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:27,278
Get the fuck off her!

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Don't you ever put your
fucking hands on me again.

37
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:30,681
Get the fuck out of my house.

38
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,127
How did you even find me?

39
00:01:36,169 --> 00:01:38,209
Your buddy, Monet Tejada.

40
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:39,851
This battle between us
has gotta end.

41
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:46,177
Tameika, where's my mom?

42
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,819
Tasha is missing.

43
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:37,048
- Here.
- Gate.

44
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,033
B, I gotta find my mom, man.

45
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,794
But how the fuck
did Tommy get to her?

46
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:45,236
Saxe.

47
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,477
Working from beyond
the fucking grave.

48
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,678
He had a fail-safe just in case

49
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,722
anyone figured out
he was a rat.

50
00:04:50,203 --> 00:04:51,802
-Mole.
-What?

51
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:54,325
Technically,
Saxe was a mole, not a rat.

52
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:56,369
Who gives a fuck?
It's the same shit.

53
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,770
Either way, that mole knew
where my mom was,

54
00:04:59,812 --> 00:05:01,612
and he told Monet,
and Monet told Tommy.

55
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:02,893
Fuck.

56
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,375
I mean, why would she do that?

57
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:05,736
I don't know.

58
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:07,178
All I know is,
I'm taking Tommy and Monet

59
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,499
- off the fucking map.
- Okay, whoa.

60
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,700
We can't make that move

61
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,901
with Lauren about to testify

62
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,223
<i>and Effie in custody.</i>

63
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:15,346
If she flips on us,
we're fucked, 'Riq.

64
00:05:15,388 --> 00:05:17,828
-You think--
-Who knows, bro?

65
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,273
I mean, at least your uncle
isn't a threat to us anymore.

66
00:05:21,794 --> 00:05:23,796
You're good with all that,
right?

67
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,159
He's a fucking coward.

68
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:31,282
Look, I can't even--can't even
think about shit like that

69
00:05:31,324 --> 00:05:32,763
until I know my mom's
all right.

70
00:05:32,805 --> 00:05:34,807
What can I do?

71
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:37,608
You strapped?

72
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,050
Yeah, I'm strapped,
motherfucker.

73
00:05:39,092 --> 00:05:40,331
Let me see that.

74
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,375
Hurry up.

75
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,537
All right, good looking.

76
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,578
I'ma hit you
when I need you, a'ight?

77
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,699
Bet.

78
00:06:01,834 --> 00:06:04,195
Monet Tejada.

79
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,797
I'm surprised
it's taken this long.

80
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,799
We don't need to chitchat.

81
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,082
That's a lot of product you've
got sitting on them shelves.

82
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:12,403
You asked for this meeting.

83
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:14,445
You must have
a solution for me.

84
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,327
For which problem?

85
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,449
Your Wall Street operations
are shut down,

86
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,211
the feds are at the gate,

87
00:06:20,253 --> 00:06:21,532
and weight ain't moving
through the Ivies

88
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,574
because that girl Effie
got locked up.

89
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,378
I did not want to worry you
prematurely.

90
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,220
I was told
it would all be rectified.

91
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:30,541
<i>Who told you that shit?</i>

92
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,982
That Tariq nigga?

93
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,384
You can't trust him.

94
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,466
Only my streets
is bringing in money right now

95
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:37,068
because I finessed
the Russians,

96
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,750
took Kai out,
and wiped out the Castillos.

97
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:41,992
Do I have a solution?

98
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,755
I'm the solution.

99
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:46,397
Empty promise.

100
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,319
How will you manage
our operations

101
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:51,402
when your own children want
nothing to do with you?

102
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,524
Look, if you back me,
I'll keep them in line,

103
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:55,005
get your weight moving again.

104
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,172
Before I could possibly agree
to this,

105
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,654
I need some answers.

106
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:07,298
What happened to my fiancé,
Mecca?

107
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:19,029
Tariq! Oh, my God.

108
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,551
-It's been so long.
-Cut the shit.

109
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:22,913
-Where's Tommy?
-You fucking kidding me.

110
00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,074
Is that how you wanna talk
to me?

111
00:07:24,116 --> 00:07:26,277
Okay. Where's Tommy, ma'am?

112
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,078
He's dead.
Didn't you get the memo?

113
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,320
Listen,
this is serious shit.

114
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,364
I need to know where Tommy is.
Now.

115
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,804
All right, I expect
you're not gonna go away

116
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,848
unless you see for yourself.

117
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,251
<i>What are you...</i>

118
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,254
Tariq, he's not here.

119
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,176
He never is.

120
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:46,617
Come on.

121
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,018
- What did he do?
- Listen.

122
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,660
He went after
my fucking mother, all right?

123
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:51,142
And I swear to God,
if anything happens to her--

124
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,023
Tariq, I raised your dad,

125
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:54,185
my son is a drug lord,

126
00:07:54,227 --> 00:07:55,826
his father was a made man,

127
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,548
and I have pictures of you
in diapers,

128
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,831
so just calm down.

129
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:03,155
Take your hand
off the fucking gun.

130
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:08,561
Okay, good.

131
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:11,764
Nobody's gonna hurt you here,
sweetie.

132
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,648
Oh...

133
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,689
What are you drinking?

134
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,690
Hennessy?

135
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,131
I don't usually drink.

136
00:08:21,173 --> 00:08:22,653
Juice box?

137
00:08:22,695 --> 00:08:23,854
Look, I need to find my mother,

138
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:24,895
and Tommy's
the only fucking person

139
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,337
that knows where she is.

140
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,539
What, are you gonna shoot me
if I don't tell you?

141
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:30,901
<i>Come on.</i>

142
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,543
That never occurred to you.

143
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:34,104
Sit down.

144
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,786
You're a good kid,

145
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,709
in spite of
all your role models.

146
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,511
Yeah, Mrs. Egan, I'm afraid
I'm not the same kid

147
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,552
that you remember.

148
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,074
Well, I can see that, baby.

149
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:46,118
But you know,
I don't know shit.

150
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,602
This woman with red hair--
her name was Monique.

151
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:52,923
<i>Whoa, whoa, M-Monet?</i>

152
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,004
Her.

153
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:55,446
So she came to my house,

154
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:56,607
and she gave me a letter.

155
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,008
She wanted me to give it
to Tommy.

156
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,650
That fucking letter had
my mom's address on it.

157
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:01,532
Well, I didn't know that,
Tariq.

158
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,614
You know
I try not to get involved.

159
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:06,577
Listen, if you can tell Tommy
that Monet dropped by,

160
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:08,058
you can tell him
that I'm looking for him.

161
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,941
Hey, hey, Tariq,
you're still a kid.

162
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,344
And- and what I do know about
my son

163
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:18,188
is that you never wanna get
on his wrong side.

164
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,950
We both have that in common.

165
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:27,758
Mecca meant this for me.

166
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,959
Keep it.

167
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,120
I don't want that shit.

168
00:09:32,285 --> 00:09:33,884
You didn't love Mecca?

169
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:35,005
No.

170
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,488
Your son Zeke.

171
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,969
Mecca was his father.

172
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,291
Yes.

173
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,732
And now you wanna use me

174
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:43,974
to bring your family back
into your fold.

175
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,856
<i>Interesting choice.</i>

176
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,938
Look, I'm trying
to protect my family.

177
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,860
Wouldn't expect you
to understand that.

178
00:09:49,902 --> 00:09:51,141
Let's be clear.

179
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:52,983
You don't know anything
about me.

180
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,905
But if I had children,
I'd keep them as far away

181
00:09:54,947 --> 00:09:56,947
from this world as possible,
love.

182
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,029
Well, I tried that shit
with Zeke,

183
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:01,632
and he's the one
who's dead now.

184
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:04,675
Yeah, and I'm sorry
for your loss.

185
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:06,437
Were you trying
to protect Zeke?

186
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:07,758
<i>Is that what happened</i>
<i>to Mecca?</i>

187
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,879
<i>Look, I ain't admitting</i>
<i>to shit,</i>

188
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,401
<i>but I will tell you this much.</i>

189
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,803
I will kill
to protect my family.

190
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,005
<i>So an ex-lover killed Mecca.</i>

191
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,087
How fucking ordinary.

192
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,208
Well, if that's the case,

193
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,490
you really gonna let a fuckboy

194
00:10:19,532 --> 00:10:20,691
get between our business?

195
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,252
A woman in my position

196
00:10:22,294 --> 00:10:24,935
has to consider all the angles
to stay on top.

197
00:10:24,977 --> 00:10:27,898
Mecca's murder,
I never saw it coming.

198
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,980
He kept you and your son
a secret.

199
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:32,182
I was so blind,

200
00:10:32,224 --> 00:10:33,664
so in the dark,

201
00:10:33,706 --> 00:10:35,706
it made me feel vulnerable.

202
00:10:35,748 --> 00:10:38,268
And I can't afford that, love.

203
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,632
I understand the need
for that control.

204
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,275
Yeah, well, I'm sure
we have many things in common.

205
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:47,998
And I can't tolerate deception.

206
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,560
In any form.

207
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:51,842
I've served you loyally, Noma.

208
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,085
And you'll continue to do so
with a reminder.

209
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,536
Are we clear, Mrs. Tejada?

210
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,017
Crystal.

211
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,061
Good.

212
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:11,742
Anything suspicious
about the Weston suicide?

213
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:13,023
Abso-fucking-lutely.

214
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:14,505
Nothing we can prove.

215
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:15,706
Circle the wagons.

216
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,147
We need to protect
the witnesses.

217
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,589
Where are we with Morales?

218
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,991
Transferred into federal
custody and processed.

219
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,594
Couple nights in the MCC
will soften her up.

220
00:11:23,636 --> 00:11:25,756
And after Lauren testifies
in front of the grand jury,

221
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:27,838
we'll have Effie indicted
on attempted murder.

222
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,199
- She'll cave.
- Hmm.

223
00:11:29,241 --> 00:11:31,402
She'll connect Tariq
to the Tejadas,

224
00:11:31,444 --> 00:11:34,084
and then we can charge
Diana Tejada with the RICO,

225
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,166
and she'll fold on the rest
of the organisation.

226
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,409
I'll finish digging
into Morales' records.

227
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:40,170
These two girls,
Effie and Diana,

228
00:11:40,212 --> 00:11:41,291
both
Stansfield students?

229
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:42,933
With promising futures.

230
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,254
That's pretty savage.

231
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:46,298
That's how we play it.

232
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:48,739
Good afternoon, Miss Baldwin.

233
00:11:48,781 --> 00:11:50,783
<i>We're here to talk you through</i>
<i>the grand jury hearing.</i>

234
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,664
I talked to Cooper Saxe.

235
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:55,105
How is his death related
to this?

236
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,266
Was that Tariq?

237
00:11:56,308 --> 00:11:58,308
Of course it was.

238
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,550
We're still investigating.

239
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,832
<i>We're not ready</i>
<i>to make that case.</i>

240
00:12:01,874 --> 00:12:03,474
The words "grand jury"
may sound scary,

241
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:04,675
but it's not a trial.

242
00:12:04,717 --> 00:12:06,997
The process
is merely a formality.

243
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,799
Typically,
an AUSA would take over,

244
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,280
but I've been waived in,

245
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,442
<i>so I'll be with you</i>
<i>every step of the way,</i>

246
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:12,483
<i>asking the questions.</i>

247
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:13,644
And no defence,

248
00:12:13,686 --> 00:12:15,005
no cross-examination.

249
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:16,647
You just say what you know.

250
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,248
They'll assess the evidence

251
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,292
and vote to indict Ms. Morales.

252
00:12:21,053 --> 00:12:23,013
You're not asking me
to blame this on Tariq?

253
00:12:23,055 --> 00:12:24,935
No, no. Effie is our goal here.

254
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:26,256
This is about getting justice
for you.

255
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,858
Justice?

256
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,860
My life is never gonna be
the same.

257
00:12:29,902 --> 00:12:31,101
<i>I hear you, Lauren.</i>

258
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,222
I do.

259
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:33,904
But it'll be a life,

260
00:12:33,946 --> 00:12:36,787
<i>and your bravery</i>
<i>will keep others safe.</i>

261
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,108
I wanna see my family.

262
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,551
Soon. I promise.

263
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,913
Please don't do anything crazy
in the home stretch.

264
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:44,795
You don't wanna expose them,
Lauren.

265
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,320
Yo, what the fuck
you doing here?

266
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:51,762
It seems y'all can't keep
Noma happy,

267
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,244
so I'm your new boss now.

268
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,850
-You're welcome.
-Fuck, nah.

269
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:01,812
-No, no.
-Dru, chill the fuck out.

270
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:02,933
<i>This ain't no game.</i>

271
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:05,896
So we answer to you now?

272
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:08,779
If you answer to Noma,
you answer to Monet.

273
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,220
In other words,
no more fucking around.

274
00:13:10,262 --> 00:13:12,062
Cane, Dru,
you back on the streets.

275
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:13,664
Tell your sister to call me.

276
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,025
And you two
<i>Trading Places</i> motherfuckers

277
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,787
owe me some serious money.

278
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,989
Wipe that fucking smirk
off your face.

279
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,831
Y'all gave my money
to the country club crooks,

280
00:13:20,873 --> 00:13:22,953
<i>so your name</i>
<i>is on that bill now too.</i>

281
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:24,635
And y'all gotta make
Noma whole again too.

282
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,917
So put your fucking
Beavis and Butt-Heads together

283
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,358
and find a new market.

284
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,960
The only thing keeping you
alive is your debt.

285
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,441
And you.

286
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:32,923
We need to talk.

287
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,250
Now, why the fuck you telling
my kids I killed Lorenzo?

288
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:41,291
How the fuck
would I know that shit?

289
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,733
I ain't tell them nothing.

290
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,575
Well, you knew it wasn't GTG
that killed Zeke,

291
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:46,056
and I'm sure you figured out
the rest of that shit too.

292
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:47,658
Oh, that's why you sent Tommy
after my mother.

293
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,939
Nigga, I don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

294
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,300
I ain't have shit
to do with that.

295
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:51,742
But if it was left up to me,

296
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:53,463
Cane would be digging
your grave right now.

297
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,865
But lucky for you,
you need to keep

298
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:56,466
your little bitches in line
first.

299
00:13:56,508 --> 00:13:58,909
Effie and Lauren can't talk.

300
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,151
-Am I clear?
-Yes.

301
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:08,478
Tariq, a moment.

302
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,920
The green cards.

303
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:11,241
My family received approval.

304
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,683
Yeah, I know that,
but you were supposed

305
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:13,764
to stall Noma until
we figured something out.

306
00:14:13,806 --> 00:14:15,005
Yet Noma knows everything

307
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:16,366
and Monet's now
the fucking boss?

308
00:14:16,408 --> 00:14:19,850
This is what I received
from stalling Noma.

309
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,852
Be happy she prevented Monet
from killing you

310
00:14:21,894 --> 00:14:24,014
till the heat was off
of our enterprise.

311
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:25,816
It will benefit us all

312
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:28,659
when you are back
in Noma's good graces.

313
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,583
Use the time wisely.

314
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:34,545
I will.

315
00:14:35,988 --> 00:14:36,907
<i>Hey, what's up? It's Di.</i>

316
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:37,908
<i>Leave a message.</i>

317
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,950
Diana, get over your shit

318
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:41,311
<i>and call me back.</i>

319
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:42,352
<i>We need to talk</i>
<i>about Saxe's letters.</i>

320
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:44,434
Is Tariq a snitch or not?

321
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:05,135
Don't do nothing stupid.

322
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:06,256
And follow me.

323
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,185
You got some fucking balls.

324
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:17,067
You brought a fucking gun
to my mother's house?

325
00:15:17,109 --> 00:15:18,108
This exact fucking one,
Uncle Tommy.

326
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,590
I swear to my life I'll use it

327
00:15:19,632 --> 00:15:20,591
if you don't tell me
what happened to my mother.

328
00:15:20,633 --> 00:15:22,993
Yeah, all right.

329
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:25,756
You quit popping off,
and I'll tell you.

330
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:28,919
Put the gun down first, Tariq.

331
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,961
You wanna know where your
mother is, put the gun away.

332
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:34,847
We hashed it out, okay?

333
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,567
You got the drop on me.

334
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:39,770
<i>And then thank God your mother</i>
<i>knocked you the fuck out,</i>

335
00:15:39,812 --> 00:15:41,932
'cause you was about to shoot.

336
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,214
I love you,
but I'll put a bullet in you

337
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:45,696
to stop you
from killing my mother.

338
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:48,338
You think you're finally
gonna kill me, huh?

339
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,701
Well, you killed your father.

340
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:52,823
So pulling the trigger on me
ain't gonna be nothing to you.

341
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:54,867
<i>No.</i>

342
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,274
I just saved your life, Tommy.

343
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,077
What, you're gonna kill me

344
00:16:07,119 --> 00:16:09,399
while I'm trying to check
on my baby?

345
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,600
Yeah, come here.

346
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:12,202
You gotta turn him like this.

347
00:16:12,244 --> 00:16:13,884
Towards you,
so he's on his side.

348
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:15,605
Okay, okay, be careful, please.

349
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:17,447
I ain't the one
who just knocked his ass out.

350
00:16:17,489 --> 00:16:19,009
He's fine.

351
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:21,053
He's just sleeping it off.

352
00:16:22,054 --> 00:16:23,573
Why'd you do this?

353
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,936
You had the drop on me.

354
00:16:25,978 --> 00:16:28,298
I've already lost
too much family, Tommy.

355
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,940
We don't need
to kill each other.

356
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:32,462
Let's dead this shit.

357
00:16:32,504 --> 00:16:34,184
Family.

358
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,986
What about me?

359
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,507
What about Keisha?

360
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:40,911
You think I wanted
to kill my best friend?

361
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:42,352
Like that shit was easy?

362
00:16:42,394 --> 00:16:44,114
She was gonna rat on my son

363
00:16:44,156 --> 00:16:45,315
and then she was gonna rat on
you.

364
00:16:45,357 --> 00:16:48,839
-No.
-No, I saved your life again.

365
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,480
Listen to me.

366
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,443
Our blood feud ends now.

367
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:55,205
Or else we're gonna end up
in the grave

368
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,607
just like Lakeisha,
just like Ghost.

369
00:16:59,011 --> 00:17:00,931
Fuck.

370
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,694
Tasha...

371
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:05,055
Fuck.

372
00:17:05,097 --> 00:17:08,298
Look, I love you, Tommy.
I never stopped.

373
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,901
Don't ever forget how we've
been there for each other.

374
00:17:10,943 --> 00:17:13,623
We are day-ones.

375
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,425
We're the only ones left.

376
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,428
I know.

377
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,791
I just feel like
I keep losing my people.

378
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,592
So let's not lose each other.

379
00:17:24,316 --> 00:17:27,597
God, Tash, I wish we could
just smoke a blunt

380
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:28,679
and ride around the city.

381
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,000
I got so much I wanna tell you.

382
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,601
-You know, I got a brother?
-What?

383
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:32,883
That's insane, Tommy.

384
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,084
Oh, yeah.
I mean, it's a half-brother.

385
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:35,926
But he got a son.

386
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:38,368
I'm a actual uncle now.

387
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,932
So you know it's real
when I tell you

388
00:17:41,974 --> 00:17:44,574
I want this shit to be over.

389
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,216
I trust you
with that information.

390
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:48,298
So is my family safe from you?

391
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,420
'Cause your family's safe
from me.

392
00:17:50,462 --> 00:17:53,063
What the fuck you mean, Tommy?

393
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,025
We are family.

394
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,149
I love you, too, Tash.

395
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,352
But I gotta get
the fuck up out of here.

396
00:18:02,394 --> 00:18:04,396
All right.

397
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,116
Where is she?

398
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:07,437
I don't know.

399
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:09,159
When the marshals showed up,
we took off.

400
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:11,281
But I know she wouldn't
want you going after Monet.

401
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,843
You speak for my mother now.

402
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,404
If you put Monet in the ground,

403
00:18:14,446 --> 00:18:16,086
<i>then you're getting</i>
<i>your mother,</i>

404
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,488
your other sister,
and your grandmother killed.

405
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,330
Uncle Tommy, fuck that noise.

406
00:18:20,372 --> 00:18:21,651
Okay?

407
00:18:21,693 --> 00:18:22,893
Monet made a fucking move
already.

408
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,974
I need to retaliate.

409
00:18:24,016 --> 00:18:26,016
You ain't got no ally.

410
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,737
<i>You ain't got no plan for war.</i>

411
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,699
You need to rethink
your beef with her.

412
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,901
You think I can't handle
a fucking war

413
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,982
by myself, Uncle Tommy?

414
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:33,743
I know you can't ride one out

415
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,786
from the back of a fucking
college classroom.

416
00:18:35,828 --> 00:18:37,187
Your father tried
to ride one out

417
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:38,829
from between two worlds.

418
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:41,071
It's what fucked him up.

419
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:42,392
If you wanna survive,

420
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,554
you either a civilian
or a gangster.

421
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:45,715
There ain't no in-between.

422
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:46,797
Stay in your lane.

423
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,398
All in or all out.

424
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,801
If you get distracted...

425
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,845
you dead.

426
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,809
A'ight,
so say I do hear you out.

427
00:18:58,851 --> 00:19:00,490
<i>Say I'm all in.</i>

428
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,092
You care, right?

429
00:19:02,134 --> 00:19:04,134
You proved that
by having my fucking back.

430
00:19:06,818 --> 00:19:10,060
Oh, Tariq...

431
00:19:10,102 --> 00:19:12,262
this ain't my war.

432
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:15,585
Plus, in New York,
I'm already dead.

433
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,038
Be smart, Tariq.

434
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:41,291
<i>Less than 24 hours away,</i>

435
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,414
and polls show Rashad Tate
firmly in the lead

436
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:46,296
over his rival, AVH,

437
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:49,019
<i>to be the twelfth district's</i>
<i>democratic nominee.</i>

438
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:51,021
And in New York,
that's a guaranteed ticket

439
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:52,302
to Congress.

440
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:55,825
Okay, okay, okay.

441
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:58,068
Please, not until after
the election.

442
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,709
Don't jinx my ass.

443
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:04,154
Taking on Weston Holdings
was brave.

444
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:06,036
Courage is never something
that I lacked.

445
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,598
No, courage was never
your problem.

446
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Ethical conviction
was your issue,

447
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:13,163
but you showed me

448
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:15,685
you are who I hoped
you could be.

449
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:17,247
And I'm very proud of you.

450
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:18,448
Thank you.

451
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,171
So maybe we can try again.

452
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:23,573
Only if I can do it
the right way, baby.

453
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:25,015
"The right way"?

454
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,056
We will,
of course, be with you...

455
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:28,338
Rashad...

456
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,540
You know your knees are bad.

457
00:20:30,582 --> 00:20:34,224
Harper, I'm gonna ask you
a third time.

458
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,825
Will you marry me?

459
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,228
-Yes.
-Yes!

460
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,469
Yes!

461
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,796
I love you.

462
00:20:46,838 --> 00:20:48,638
Oh!

463
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,683
So Monet's just
our fucking boss now.

464
00:20:53,725 --> 00:20:55,685
She made the one move she had.

465
00:20:55,727 --> 00:20:57,487
It was smart.

466
00:20:57,529 --> 00:20:59,769
Forcing her kids to work
for her under penalty of death

467
00:20:59,811 --> 00:21:00,850
is smart?

468
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:02,492
She's a fucking sociopath.

469
00:21:02,534 --> 00:21:03,893
Does it matter?

470
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,615
We ain't got
nowhere else to go.

471
00:21:05,657 --> 00:21:06,937
Oh, no, I forgot.
He's a fucking mama's boy.

472
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:08,858
Always has been,
always will be.

473
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,380
If I was you,
I'd shut the fuck up.

474
00:21:10,422 --> 00:21:13,023
I'm so tired
of your fucking bullshit.

475
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,304
Do you even care
that she killed our father?

476
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:15,425
Enough! Hey!

477
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:17,067
Stop, okay?

478
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,029
This beef ain't between us.

479
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,391
It's Monet again.

480
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:22,672
She's always
the fucking problem.

481
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,716
Y'all know that.

482
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,158
When will y'all realise
we don't live normal lives?

483
00:21:29,841 --> 00:21:31,241
Seriously.

484
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:33,964
Dru, I need you
to man the fuck up, okay?

485
00:21:34,006 --> 00:21:36,646
You're not gonna be
a NBA housewife.

486
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:38,088
And Diana,
let's stop pretending

487
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,210
you're some college
sorority chick, all right?

488
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:42,092
We're drug dealers.

489
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,853
That's the family business.

490
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,216
That's who we are.

491
00:21:46,258 --> 00:21:49,699
Now, I have
a collection to hit.

492
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,909
You know what?

493
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,072
Fuck both of them.

494
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,194
They're never gonna see us
coming.

495
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:07,437
And by the time they do,
it'll be too fucking late.

496
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,205
Nice of you to join us.

497
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:16,886
What the fuck
don't you understand

498
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:18,328
about family emergency?

499
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,409
I'm here now.

500
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:21,491
My brother is dead, Brayden.

501
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:24,254
Show some goddamn unity.

502
00:22:24,296 --> 00:22:25,735
I think you guys
should just all

503
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,537
get out of the city
for a while.

504
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,380
You know, avoid all the media,
cops, all that bullshit.

505
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:32,022
No, Brayden's right.

506
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:34,384
I can't go out on the street
without being heckled.

507
00:22:34,426 --> 00:22:37,027
Jesus, you're all
thinking about yourselves.

508
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,788
What about a fucking funeral
for Uncle Lucas?

509
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,909
Oh, Becca's right.

510
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:41,151
What about Uncle Lucas?

511
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,912
No one's even fucking
going to that.

512
00:22:42,954 --> 00:22:43,913
What the fuck?

513
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:45,235
Mom, Dad, Becca,

514
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:46,316
<i>you might wanna get</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

515
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:48,158
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

516
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,120
Your family owes
my family money.

517
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:52,362
I have no idea
who the hell you people are,

518
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,045
<i>but we are not in a position</i>
<i>to repay anybody's losses.</i>

519
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,248
- Cane...
- Listen, man.

520
00:22:59,851 --> 00:23:01,251
You're not
in a fucking position

521
00:23:01,293 --> 00:23:02,412
- to not be in a position.
- Cane...

522
00:23:02,454 --> 00:23:03,853
let's fucking handle this
later.

523
00:23:05,337 --> 00:23:06,536
Relax, little man.

524
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:08,218
Look, everybody
calm the fuck down.

525
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,820
If you don't have the money,
these paintings right here

526
00:23:10,862 --> 00:23:12,102
damn sure don't look fake.

527
00:23:12,144 --> 00:23:13,583
Fucking nice-ass house.

528
00:23:13,625 --> 00:23:14,664
<i>Yeah, check this out, Ma.</i>

529
00:23:14,706 --> 00:23:15,745
This one got your name on it.

530
00:23:15,787 --> 00:23:16,826
Monet.

531
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,268
Yeah, right there.

532
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,429
I'll put this shit up
in the dining room.

533
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:20,630
<i>Hey...</i>

534
00:23:20,672 --> 00:23:22,232
Let me get that watch,
snowflake.

535
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,874
Oh, dude,
it's a family heirloom.

536
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,316
Oh, my God!

537
00:23:26,358 --> 00:23:27,997
- All right.
- All right. Appreciate it.

538
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,039
I'll make sure I let the nigga
at the pawn shop know that.

539
00:23:30,081 --> 00:23:33,563
Hey, all this shit,
it's just a down payment.

540
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,448
We'll be back
for all this shit.

541
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,296
What the fuck, son?

542
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,458
<i>You had every opportunity</i>
<i>to leave that life behind.</i>

543
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,141
You are not one of them.

544
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,463
Yeah, you didn't learn your
fucking lesson the first time?

545
00:23:53,505 --> 00:23:54,944
Me?

546
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:57,347
Your brother was the biggest
crook in the generation.

547
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:58,708
You're gonna act like
this is the first time

548
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,110
you suspected anything?

549
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:01,351
Yeah, okay.

550
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:03,233
See if the SEC buys
that bullshit.

551
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,834
This fucking family.

552
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:16,166
- You spoke to your sister?
- Yeah.

553
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:19,088
Shit that happened to Pops
really fucked them up.

554
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,491
All right?
Dru and Diana might be out.

555
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:22,892
Nah.

556
00:24:22,934 --> 00:24:24,334
That ain't gonna work for me.

557
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:26,658
Yeah, well, you gonna
have to work your magic.

558
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,500
When was you gonna tell me
Effie got locked up?

559
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,422
Yeah, Davis told me.

560
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:33,543
Can I count on you, Cane?

561
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:35,064
'Cause me and you both know

562
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,666
that Tariq is not gonna be able
to handle this shit.

563
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,988
Listen, don't trip
about Effie, all right?

564
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,870
She didn't snitch out Tariq
like I asked her to.

565
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,753
But she held it down.
She kept it 100.

566
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,797
Are you--
nigga, you are pussy whipped.

567
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:50,760
Can't you see this bitch
is out for herself?

568
00:24:50,802 --> 00:24:52,804
Man, fuck it.
I-I'll handle it on my own.

569
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,847
Fuck.

570
00:24:59,771 --> 00:25:01,171
On the gate.

571
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:12,342
Why are you changing my cell?

572
00:25:12,384 --> 00:25:15,144
Do I look like I'm here
to answer your questions?

573
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:27,997
Looks like we got
another bad bitch.

574
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:29,959
Lights out at nine.

575
00:25:52,744 --> 00:25:54,504
<i>Good, you're here. Look.</i>

576
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:55,905
From what you told me,
you need to leave

577
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:57,747
this Monet shit alone,
all right?

578
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:58,908
She said she didn't do it.

579
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,990
Obviously,
she's gonna fucking lie.

580
00:26:01,032 --> 00:26:03,233
I'm only alive
'cause I owe money.

581
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:05,635
If I may suggest,

582
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:08,238
when your lawyer
and your homicidal white uncle

583
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,241
both tell you not to start
a war, you should listen.

584
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,283
And we have more pressing shit.

585
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:15,847
The feds have me on camera
passing a note to Diana.

586
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:18,368
You gotta get her
charges dropped.

587
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,649
Or else I go down with her.

588
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,693
Trust me, I'm working on that.

589
00:26:22,774 --> 00:26:24,854
What the fuck happened
at Weston Holdings?

590
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,055
You know, I think it was

591
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:27,377
the fucking
Councilman Tate nigga.

592
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,459
- Shit.
- Yeah.

593
00:26:29,501 --> 00:26:32,824
Okay, I- I'd recommend
not murdering a congressman.

594
00:26:33,665 --> 00:26:36,225
But having leverage on Tate
could be useful.

595
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:37,667
Oh, you know
that snake-ass motherfucker

596
00:26:37,709 --> 00:26:38,828
is always up for a deal.

597
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,149
That's for damn sure.

598
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,231
I'll take care of that.

599
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:45,276
And you, my friend,
need to focus on Effie.

600
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,597
She has to go, Tariq.

601
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,238
Whoa, whoa.

602
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,480
Ain't that exactly
what the fuck

603
00:26:50,522 --> 00:26:51,681
you're not supposed to say?

604
00:26:51,723 --> 00:26:53,603
She's not on our side.

605
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,046
If she folds,
we all get jumpsuits.

606
00:26:57,088 --> 00:26:58,848
Didn't she snitch on you
before?

607
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,770
Yes, but it's not that simple.

608
00:27:00,812 --> 00:27:02,892
All right, obviously, the feds
will lock us the fuck up.

609
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:04,614
But Noma will kill us.

610
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:05,975
Effie has the picture
that I need

611
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,697
to get out from under
Noma's thumb.

612
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:11,260
You'll never get to use it
if Lauren testifies,

613
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:13,863
which reminds me,
she has to go too.

614
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:15,945
What the fuck are you on
right now, Davis?

615
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,587
You sound like Monet, my nigga.
Stay in your lane.

616
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:19,268
I don't give a fuck anymore.

617
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,431
Those are your bitches.

618
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,193
Since when is killing
a problem for you?

619
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:28,277
I learned that killing leads
to more fucking problems.

620
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,999
Listen, I understand
you just lost your brother.

621
00:27:30,041 --> 00:27:31,160
I get exactly how you feel.

622
00:27:31,202 --> 00:27:32,482
I lost my twin sister

623
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:34,364
right in front
of my fucking eyes, Davis.

624
00:27:34,406 --> 00:27:36,085
But now's not the time
to crash out.

625
00:27:36,127 --> 00:27:38,768
You gotta pull
your shit together.

626
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,010
All right, what if she recants?

627
00:27:41,052 --> 00:27:43,693
What's her incentive?

628
00:27:43,735 --> 00:27:45,054
She gotta feel more in danger

629
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,616
if she testifies
than if she doesn't.

630
00:27:46,658 --> 00:27:48,658
Exactly.

631
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,901
I hear her parents came back
to town after Effie's arrest.

632
00:27:51,943 --> 00:27:53,863
That could be a soft spot.

633
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:56,386
But recanting won't
outright solve it.

634
00:27:56,428 --> 00:27:59,188
They'd still have time
to trump up some other charges

635
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,510
against Effie.

636
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:03,072
Unless...

637
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:05,955
Will Effie talk to you?

638
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:07,957
Yeah, I think so.

639
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
You have to convince her

640
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,962
to do something
she won't wanna do.

641
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:37,427
Hey!

642
00:28:37,469 --> 00:28:40,109
Drop it. Drop it.

643
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,751
Get the fuck off of me!

644
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:43,913
You're trying
to fucking kill me?

645
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:47,997
Tougher than I thought.

646
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,563
You have a visitor.

647
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:05,415
What happened? You okay?

648
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:07,777
So I can assume it wasn't you
that sent that warning?

649
00:29:07,819 --> 00:29:09,018
I don't know
what you're talking about.

650
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,062
What the fuck
are you here for then?

651
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,862
I got a plan to get you out.

652
00:29:12,904 --> 00:29:14,744
I don't need shit from you.

653
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,145
My lawyer's coming
to sort this out.

654
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,226
I have my own money.

655
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,908
I'm gonna post my own bail.

656
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,952
You know, you can't post bail,
right, Effie?

657
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:23,993
Nigga, are you crazy?

658
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:25,234
Are you trying
to get me killed?

659
00:29:25,276 --> 00:29:26,916
Listen, Davis said
if you post bail,

660
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:28,638
they have months to indict you.

661
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,399
But if you sit, they have
to impanel a whole grand jury

662
00:29:30,441 --> 00:29:31,641
to indict you in five days.

663
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:33,322
How does less time help me?

664
00:29:33,364 --> 00:29:35,805
Because once they get
the charges dropped,

665
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,567
they'll have less time
to find out anything else.

666
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:38,928
You'll walk.

667
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,129
Look, we haven't seen
eye to eye,

668
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:43,054
but we're on the same team,
right?

669
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,897
Because you need something
from me?

670
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,979
That picture
of Noma's daughter, yes.

671
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,180
I need it.

672
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:53,543
If I get it,
figure out who she is,

673
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:54,744
I'll get you out,

674
00:29:54,786 --> 00:29:56,546
and I'll get us out
from under Noma.

675
00:29:56,588 --> 00:29:59,228
Well, I found her already.

676
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,630
The fuck you mean
you found her?

677
00:30:00,672 --> 00:30:02,512
I found her already.

678
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:04,754
And you're not getting
a goddamn thing

679
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,395
until you get me
the fuck out of here.

680
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,319
All right,
so they need a grand jury

681
00:30:10,361 --> 00:30:12,041
to indict Effie in five days.

682
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:15,084
That's our window to get Lauren
a reversal story against Effie.

683
00:30:15,126 --> 00:30:17,128
Effie gets clear, we walk free.

684
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,089
I don't think we got
enough time for that.

685
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:21,370
I will cut
that fucking hand off.

686
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,093
When did baby Rambo's
balls drop, huh?

687
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:25,454
<i>Listen, listen, listen.</i>

688
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:26,375
Only way we get Lauren
to change her story

689
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:27,456
is if we work together.

690
00:30:27,498 --> 00:30:28,457
So both of y'all
shut the fuck up

691
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:29,699
and listen, all right?

692
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,260
What you got?

693
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,222
Remember when Obi dropped
pictures of our families?

694
00:30:33,264 --> 00:30:35,024
We're gonna threaten
Lauren's parents?

695
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,907
But just with pictures.
Look, she needs to understand

696
00:30:37,949 --> 00:30:40,550
that even WITSEC can't protect
her and her family, bro.

697
00:30:40,592 --> 00:30:42,431
Look, I'ma set up
a meeting with us.

698
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:43,513
You guys talk to her.

699
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:44,794
You guys show her the pictures.

700
00:30:44,836 --> 00:30:46,275
We promise her safety

701
00:30:46,317 --> 00:30:48,838
in return for her recanting
her story on Effie.

702
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,680
Dru and I will get the photos.

703
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:52,724
Bet. I'll have Davis
show y'all where to get them.

704
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:54,924
Just tell me
when you wanna leave.

705
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:56,165
I swear to God--

706
00:30:56,207 --> 00:30:57,286
Yo, yo, yo,
shut the fuck up, man.

707
00:30:57,328 --> 00:30:59,330
We got shit to do.

708
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:14,664
You better have a damn good
reason for calling.

709
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,986
Lauren, listen.

710
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:19,148
You can't testify, all right?
It's not safe.

711
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,790
So someone's gonna kill me?

712
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,151
The same way you killed Saxe

713
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:23,793
after I told you
he was talking to Jenny?

714
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,555
That wasn't me.

715
00:31:25,597 --> 00:31:27,236
All right?
Saxe was dirty as fuck.

716
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,518
<i>He dug his grave</i>
<i>100 times over.</i>

717
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,240
How do you even trust the feds?

718
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:32,642
They can't even keep
their own people safe.

719
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,163
<i>They don't even let you see</i>
<i>your family.</i>

720
00:31:34,205 --> 00:31:35,565
<i>Come on, listen.</i>

721
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:36,686
<i>I'm the only person</i>
<i>that can help you</i>

722
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,007
<i>in your situation, all right?</i>

723
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:40,690
And how am I supposed
to trust that?

724
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,171
If I wanted to hurt you,
you've given me

725
00:31:42,213 --> 00:31:44,614
the opportunity to do so
a million times already.

726
00:31:44,656 --> 00:31:46,535
<i>Just trust me.</i>
<i>I got a plan.</i>

727
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,777
<i>Meet up with me,</i>
<i>and we'll speak about it.</i>

728
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:49,498
<i>Please.</i>

729
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:55,184
Okay, but it needs to be
in public.

730
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:57,266
I'll meet you tonight
in Fort Greene Park.

731
00:31:57,308 --> 00:31:58,868
All right, I'll be there.

732
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,429
Thank you.

733
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,165
<i>I know.</i>

734
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:18,127
We have to keep trying.

735
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,288
I--

736
00:32:20,652 --> 00:32:22,051
Sterling?

737
00:32:23,334 --> 00:32:24,854
Let me call you back.

738
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,020
We need you
to quiet the fuck down,

739
00:32:31,062 --> 00:32:32,261
Mrs. Baldwin.

740
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,950
Honestly, don't trip,
all right?

741
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,511
She lives.

742
00:32:42,553 --> 00:32:44,754
Hey, light skin.
Nice to see you again.

743
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,915
You fucking tricked me?

744
00:32:45,957 --> 00:32:48,117
Lauren, you're not
in any danger.

745
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:49,999
I tried to save you, remember?

746
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:52,001
Did you?
Look, I don't care.

747
00:32:52,043 --> 00:32:53,843
I will fuck all y'all up
before I go down.

748
00:32:53,885 --> 00:32:55,404
Look, they're just here
to make a deal.

749
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:56,966
Face to face so you know
that they're telling the truth.

750
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,367
<i>That's it.</i>

751
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,089
I wouldn't be scared
of the undynamic duo,

752
00:33:00,131 --> 00:33:02,133
but what I would
be scared of...

753
00:33:03,534 --> 00:33:04,694
Is me.

754
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:06,615
My mom and dad? Really?

755
00:33:06,657 --> 00:33:08,217
What? Cane, what the fuck?

756
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:09,618
We never spoke about this shit.

757
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,821
- Let them go right now.
- Or what, huh?

758
00:33:11,863 --> 00:33:15,064
You'll slightly puncture me
with a fucking steak knife?

759
00:33:15,106 --> 00:33:17,827
Listen, I don't listen
to this nigga, okay?

760
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:19,628
I listen to myself, all right?

761
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,031
Now, if I give you my word,
it's bond.

762
00:33:22,073 --> 00:33:24,874
Recant,
forget I fucking know you.

763
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:26,435
Yeah, you go about
your regular life.

764
00:33:26,477 --> 00:33:28,758
School, family,
back to the future

765
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,519
<i>that you've been</i>
<i>preparing for.</i>

766
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:32,641
I mean, what, you wanna be
in bum fuck Arizona

767
00:33:32,683 --> 00:33:34,203
being a cashier?

768
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:35,885
That's all WITSEC has for you,
Lauren, literally.

769
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:38,888
And what about Effie?

770
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,810
Is she in on this deal?

771
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,211
That's who tried to fucking kill
me.

772
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,693
And I'm gonna need
guarantee from that bitch

773
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:45,134
before I do shit.

774
00:33:45,176 --> 00:33:46,936
But I swear to God,
if something happens

775
00:33:46,978 --> 00:33:48,497
to my family, it is over.

776
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:50,820
Listen, let her parents go.

777
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,101
Show her she can trust us.

778
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,582
<i>-Come on.</i>
-Cane.

779
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:57,386
All right.

780
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:59,548
But remember, we always know
where to find them.

781
00:34:02,713 --> 00:34:04,433
Jenny and Blanca were right,
weren't they?

782
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,515
The drugs, murders,
it all comes back to you.

783
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:07,556
No, listen,
it wasn't supposed--

784
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:10,079
Don't!

785
00:34:10,121 --> 00:34:12,241
This is the last time
you lie to me.

786
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,167
Fuck.

787
00:34:18,209 --> 00:34:20,249
I mean,
even if this shit does work,

788
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,252
we still gotta worry about
the charges against Diana, no?

789
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:25,094
You got Davis handling
that shit, right?

790
00:34:25,136 --> 00:34:26,215
Yeah.

791
00:34:26,257 --> 00:34:27,696
Right now, in fact.

792
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:38,307
I just received
the call from AVH.

793
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:40,149
She's officially conceded
the race.

794
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:49,638
I'm happy tonight
that virtue and integrity won.

795
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,880
And I couldn't have done it

796
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,162
without my extraordinary staff:

797
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:56,605
Brushaundria, Jim, Sabrina,

798
00:34:56,647 --> 00:34:58,968
I couldn't have done it
without all of your support.

799
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,930
But mostly,
I couldn't have done it

800
00:35:00,972 --> 00:35:02,972
without the guidance

801
00:35:03,014 --> 00:35:05,334
from my lovely fiancée, Harper.

802
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:07,376
Come on. Come on up.

803
00:35:10,461 --> 00:35:12,101
-I love you.
-I love you too.

804
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,743
<i>And remember,</i>

805
00:35:13,785 --> 00:35:15,224
New York still leads the way.

806
00:35:15,266 --> 00:35:17,226
New York leads the way.

807
00:35:17,268 --> 00:35:18,667
New York leads the way!

808
00:35:25,036 --> 00:35:26,315
I'm proud of you.

809
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,677
Thank you. Thank you.

810
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,840
Thank you. Thank you so much.

811
00:35:30,882 --> 00:35:32,041
I appreciate you.

812
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:33,803
What's happening, nigga?

813
00:35:33,845 --> 00:35:36,245
Or shall I say congratulations,
Congressman?

814
00:35:36,287 --> 00:35:39,288
Ah, Davis, I didn't realise
that you were a supporter.

815
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm not.

816
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:43,132
But I have a message for you.

817
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,894
Shall we?

818
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:46,936
Thank you for
going out to those polls and...

819
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,737
Tariq and the Tejadas know
it was you

820
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:50,781
who burned them
at Weston Holdings.

821
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,702
You've got a bullet
coming your way.

822
00:35:55,146 --> 00:35:57,186
Are you sure you wanna
threaten me, my nigga?

823
00:35:57,228 --> 00:35:58,587
'Cause after tonight,
I can have your ass

824
00:35:58,629 --> 00:36:00,789
chasing after fucking
ambulances in Trenton.

825
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:03,512
Now who's threatening who?

826
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:06,715
There's something you can do
that might earn you some grace.

827
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:10,359
Get that charges
against Diana Tejada dropped,

828
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,882
and make sure
they back off me as well.

829
00:36:15,486 --> 00:36:16,886
Look at your ass.

830
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:18,167
Mm-mm.

831
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,568
But you know,

832
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,131
I'm always open
to helping friends in need,

833
00:36:22,173 --> 00:36:23,652
particularly when they donate

834
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:26,976
large sums of money
to my campaign.

835
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,218
Of course.

836
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,659
Consider it done.

837
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,024
<i>And drink!</i>

838
00:36:35,066 --> 00:36:36,825
Professor Bennet,
I was just looking for you.

839
00:36:36,867 --> 00:36:38,107
Amina Hosseini of <i>The Tribune.</i>

840
00:36:38,149 --> 00:36:39,548
Now's not a good time.

841
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:42,071
I would love to run a piece
on your love story

842
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:43,672
with Rashad Tate.

843
00:36:43,714 --> 00:36:48,077
Old flames reuniting
during the campaign.

844
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,599
Well, it would be about
the end of a love story,

845
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,281
a real fucking tragedy.

846
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:54,243
And nobody wants to read that.

847
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:56,405
So if you'll excuse me.

848
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,022
Brayden?

849
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,066
Hey.

850
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:18,027
What are you doing here?

851
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,229
Just getting my shit
out of here.

852
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:22,471
It's my last day
at Weston Holdings, so...

853
00:37:22,513 --> 00:37:24,833
SEC just cleared me.

854
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,675
You know, they also wanted
to talk to RSJ,

855
00:37:26,717 --> 00:37:28,597
but conveniently,
he's out of the country.

856
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:29,959
Guess that's one of the perks

857
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,680
of having your own private jet.

858
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:33,562
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna be stuck on coach

859
00:37:33,604 --> 00:37:35,724
on the way back home
to Columbus, so...

860
00:37:35,766 --> 00:37:37,246
You don't have to go.

861
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,487
Lucas took the blame
for everything

862
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:40,049
in his suicide note.

863
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,931
Yeah, but that doesn't change
the fact

864
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:43,492
that I know I was a part of it.

865
00:37:43,534 --> 00:37:45,534
I gotta take a step back.

866
00:37:45,576 --> 00:37:47,336
You know, look at my life.

867
00:37:47,378 --> 00:37:48,737
Start over.

868
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,899
At least you get to.

869
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:53,702
Brayden, you know how you said

870
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:56,345
that you were gonna make
all of this go away?

871
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:58,467
Your uncle wasn't a quitter.

872
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:03,712
I mean, I- I told you
where he was hiding.

873
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:05,194
That suicide note,

874
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:07,116
it- it didn't sound
anything like him.

875
00:38:12,883 --> 00:38:14,003
What are you asking me?

876
00:38:15,846 --> 00:38:17,446
Maybe...

877
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:19,488
maybe you need
to get out of here too.

878
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,849
<i>I mean, seriously.</i>

879
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:22,811
<i>Think about</i>
<i>what you're becoming.</i>

880
00:38:25,256 --> 00:38:27,096
It's a little late for that.

881
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:45,514
- I'm not an idiot.
- I know.

882
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:48,157
Okay, so this isn't about
getting justice for me.

883
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:50,719
This is about you trying
to get Effie to turn on Tariq

884
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,241
and bring down
some big drug ring

885
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:54,283
while you get justice
for your dead boyfriend

886
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,327
and maybe a promotion.

887
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:58,847
That's what I thought.

888
00:38:58,889 --> 00:39:00,929
Look, at this point,
I want Tariq gone, too,

889
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,171
but what I'm not gonna do

890
00:39:02,213 --> 00:39:03,892
is get up on that stand
and lie for you.

891
00:39:03,934 --> 00:39:05,934
So if you want Effie
to flip on Tariq,

892
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,097
let me talk to her.

893
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:11,180
Well, what makes you think
you can get Effie to flip?

894
00:39:11,222 --> 00:39:12,781
Because I can tell her
she has no reason

895
00:39:12,823 --> 00:39:13,942
to stay loyal to him.

896
00:39:13,984 --> 00:39:15,504
What do you mean?

897
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,346
Tariq wants her
to keep her mouth shut

898
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,188
and go away
so he can be with me.

899
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,110
Have you been in contact
with Tariq?

900
00:39:21,152 --> 00:39:22,231
<i>Did he tell you that?</i>

901
00:39:22,273 --> 00:39:23,952
Of course not.

902
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:25,314
But she doesn't know that.

903
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:30,959
Lauren, I've crossed
so many ethical lines already,

904
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:33,122
I- I can't ask you to do that.

905
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,643
Jenny, you have no choice.

906
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:37,366
Either I talk to Effie
or I'm not gonna testify.

907
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,767
<i>And then what?</i>

908
00:39:46,977 --> 00:39:48,897
Too much of a fair fight
last time?

909
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,998
You two play nice now.

910
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,325
This isn't being recorded.

911
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:18,807
I learned my lesson
about that shit.

912
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,890
<i>The past few months of my life</i>
<i>have been fucking hell.</i>

913
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,852
Do you understand that?

914
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:25,934
<i>And whatever it is</i>
<i>that you're into,</i>

915
00:40:25,976 --> 00:40:27,936
I'm not a part of it.

916
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:29,578
Apparently,
Tariq didn't want me dead,

917
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,101
and neither did Brayden.

918
00:40:32,143 --> 00:40:33,582
But the cops showed me pictures
of you two.

919
00:40:33,624 --> 00:40:34,863
So what was that?

920
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:35,904
You were just trying
to get rid of me?

921
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:38,707
You're thinking
way too deep into this.

922
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:40,789
So then what do I need to know?

923
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:43,472
Because if I'm not 100% sure
that this shit is over,

924
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:45,634
I have no problem
taking you guys down with me.

925
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:48,117
Lauren...

926
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:50,519
I don't give a fuck about you.

927
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,201
Not one.

928
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:55,444
You say the last couple months
of your life have been hard.

929
00:40:55,486 --> 00:40:57,326
Try since fucking birth.

930
00:40:57,368 --> 00:41:00,088
You've had every single
golden opportunity in the world

931
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,930
and I was never jealous
of that.

932
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:03,452
But you decided to step out

933
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,894
of your wide-ass,
privileged-ass lane,

934
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:08,096
and you threatened my future.

935
00:41:08,138 --> 00:41:10,539
You see, this was never
personal, Lauren.

936
00:41:10,581 --> 00:41:13,262
This was just business.

937
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,145
But if you go up there
and you snitch me out,

938
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,507
I'm afraid this is gonna
get personal really quickly.

939
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:19,548
Are you threatening me?

940
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,829
No, I'm telling you the truth.

941
00:41:20,871 --> 00:41:22,110
Well, I think
you're very confused

942
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:23,592
on who has the power
in this situation.

943
00:41:23,634 --> 00:41:25,073
- Mm.
<i>- You know what?</i>

944
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,955
I'm not the same Lauren
I used to be.

945
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,399
I didn't see you coming
last time,

946
00:41:30,441 --> 00:41:32,201
but this time,
my eyes are wide open, bitch.

947
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:36,285
Look, if you recant,
we all walk.

948
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,406
You get your old life back.

949
00:41:37,448 --> 00:41:38,767
We all get our old lives back.

950
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,210
-That's what you want.
-Jesus, you're evil.

951
00:41:41,252 --> 00:41:43,372
All of you are fucking evil.

952
00:41:43,414 --> 00:41:44,653
And somehow, you think

953
00:41:44,695 --> 00:41:46,054
you don't deserve
what you're getting.

954
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:00,629
Members of the grand jury,
you're here to decide

955
00:42:00,671 --> 00:42:02,431
whether or not
there is sufficient evidence

956
00:42:02,473 --> 00:42:04,353
to indict Josefina Morales

957
00:42:04,395 --> 00:42:06,235
for the felony
of attempted murder.

958
00:42:06,277 --> 00:42:07,676
And to help you make
that decision,

959
00:42:07,718 --> 00:42:09,758
you'll now hear
from the victim in the case,

960
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,400
Lauren Baldwin,

961
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:15,484
a dean's list student
at Stansfield University.

962
00:42:15,526 --> 00:42:17,286
Miss Baldwin,
would you tell the grand jury

963
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,330
what happened to you?

964
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:26,417
I know you've
been through a lot.

965
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:29,778
In a signed victim statement,

966
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,860
you stated that
Miss Morales kidnapped you,

967
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:34,383
<i>knocked you unconscious,</i>
<i>strapped you to your seat,</i>

968
00:42:34,425 --> 00:42:36,787
and pushed you
into an icy river.

969
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:38,987
Yes.

970
00:42:39,029 --> 00:42:41,270
That is what you told me
to say.

971
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:47,876
Lauren,
you signed this statement

972
00:42:47,918 --> 00:42:49,238
under penalty of perjury.

973
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,039
Because you forced me to.

974
00:42:52,202 --> 00:42:54,883
I wasn't well.

975
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:59,127
I was having panic attacks
over school

976
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:01,970
and, um, you know,
just the pressure.

977
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,812
<i>I don't--I don't know.</i>

978
00:43:03,854 --> 00:43:05,894
And I took a drive,

979
00:43:05,936 --> 00:43:07,536
and I...

980
00:43:07,578 --> 00:43:09,057
I'm sorry.

981
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:11,580
I started thinking
about my brother,

982
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,102
who also has panic attacks
and anxiety,

983
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:17,786
and I must have just
blacked out in my car.

984
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,628
When I woke up,
Jenny Sullivan was in the room

985
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,671
with a doctor that told me
that I was dead.

986
00:43:22,713 --> 00:43:25,634
And she told me if I ever wanna
see my parents again,

987
00:43:25,676 --> 00:43:28,557
I have to say it was Effie
who did this to me.

988
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,759
It is obvious that this witness
has been compromised.

989
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,120
Lauren, are you aware

990
00:43:32,162 --> 00:43:33,762
that you are perjuring yourself
right now?

991
00:43:33,804 --> 00:43:36,405
I was so confused,
as you can imagine.

992
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,048
But she made me believe
that this statement was true.

993
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,010
<i>But it's not.</i>

994
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:45,694
Sorry, Jenny.

995
00:43:45,736 --> 00:43:48,016
I'm done with your agenda.

996
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,778
I'd like to go home.

997
00:43:56,507 --> 00:43:57,946
What happened?

998
00:43:57,988 --> 00:43:59,868
I don't know how they
got to her, but they did.

999
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:02,871
We still have Effie in custody.

1000
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:04,072
And you only have a day left
to charge her

1001
00:44:04,114 --> 00:44:05,594
before you have to let her go.

1002
00:44:05,636 --> 00:44:07,596
And we got nothing
from busting the coffee shop.

1003
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:09,037
They played you.

1004
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,480
I'm pulling the plug

1005
00:44:11,522 --> 00:44:12,921
before we're embarrassed
any further.

1006
00:44:12,963 --> 00:44:14,883
No.
Medina, after all this time,

1007
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:15,924
you know the St. Patricks.

1008
00:44:15,966 --> 00:44:17,245
There is a way to save this.

1009
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,368
Yeah, pack it up.
Piss on the fire.

1010
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:20,729
This is done.

1011
00:44:46,797 --> 00:44:48,196
Are you okay, honey?

1012
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:50,879
Yeah, just really ready to go.

1013
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,921
Let's go, baby.

1014
00:44:52,963 --> 00:44:54,122
Thank you.

1015
00:45:14,465 --> 00:45:15,984
I don't know how you do
this shit all the time,

1016
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:17,986
but you just do.

1017
00:45:18,028 --> 00:45:19,908
You just gotta have
a little faith.

1018
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,630
Yeah, I didn't have
any other options.

1019
00:45:21,672 --> 00:45:24,753
Anyway, as agreed,

1020
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,636
turns out Noma's daughter
isn't even a kid anymore.

1021
00:45:27,678 --> 00:45:30,839
She's our age,
and she's attending NYU.

1022
00:45:30,881 --> 00:45:33,081
Are you fucking kidding me?

1023
00:45:33,123 --> 00:45:37,125
This is the name, address,
social media so you can track.

1024
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,366
I don't even think
that she knows

1025
00:45:38,408 --> 00:45:40,569
that her mom is a criminal.

1026
00:45:40,611 --> 00:45:43,614
It's like Noma kept their lives
completely separate.

1027
00:45:44,815 --> 00:45:48,939
So um, what happens to me and
this business after you do this?

1028
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:53,301
I mean, you've been on your own
before, right?

1029
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:55,183
I'm sure you can build back up.

1030
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:58,787
Just like that?

1031
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:01,069
After you set me up
at the warehouse.

1032
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:02,631
We're not even now?

1033
00:46:02,673 --> 00:46:04,112
All the shit that you said
in Italy,

1034
00:46:04,154 --> 00:46:06,675
was that--
that was just nothing?

1035
00:46:06,717 --> 00:46:08,517
What about our future?

1036
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:13,802
Effie, tell me why you think
I can trust you.

1037
00:46:13,844 --> 00:46:17,566
You went behind my back to Cane
when you should've came to me.

1038
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,848
But I'm not tripping.
It's all good.

1039
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,169
Let me take you to your dorm.
Come on.

1040
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:29,858
Yo, what are you doing?

1041
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,420
Finding my own way,
like I always do.

1042
00:46:36,466 --> 00:46:38,547
A'ight, look. Noma's daughter.

1043
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:39,948
That's the key to our freedom.

1044
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:41,750
She'll stop the fucking threats
to our families,

1045
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:43,794
and we won't have to work
for Monet.

1046
00:46:45,315 --> 00:46:47,035
Listen, 'Riq,
I don't know if I can.

1047
00:46:47,077 --> 00:46:48,356
If you can what?

1048
00:46:48,398 --> 00:46:49,478
Ride with you on this.

1049
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,719
Look, for me, I just--

1050
00:46:50,761 --> 00:46:52,000
I think it's just time to quit.

1051
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,642
Cold turkey.

1052
00:46:53,684 --> 00:46:55,524
Look, if you can use that
to get me out, cool.

1053
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,125
- Wait, wait, you--
- But if it's my head

1054
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,007
that Noma or the Tejadas
come for, then--

1055
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,329
You waited for this shit to get
this fucking hard to quit, B?

1056
00:47:01,371 --> 00:47:03,251
And then you leave me with
the bag to hold for myself.

1057
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:05,013
I killed my fucking uncle,
okay?

1058
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:06,334
He didn't jump. I pushed him.

1059
00:47:06,376 --> 00:47:07,856
You did what needed to be done,
Brayden.

1060
00:47:07,898 --> 00:47:10,258
Yeah, and it's all
I can fucking think about.

1061
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,140
My family will never
be the same.

1062
00:47:12,182 --> 00:47:14,342
We ruin people's lives, 'Riq.

1063
00:47:14,384 --> 00:47:16,384
I'm just...

1064
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:18,466
I'm not made for it.

1065
00:47:18,508 --> 00:47:20,188
-I'm sorry, but--
-Come the fuck on, bro.

1066
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,269
Come the fuck on.

1067
00:47:21,311 --> 00:47:23,313
I'm sorry. I'm out.

1068
00:47:24,314 --> 00:47:26,316
<i>Good luck.</i>

1069
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:29,359
Fuck!

1070
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:36,484
Yo, what's up?

1071
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:37,966
I need to talk to you, 'Riq.

1072
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:40,769
It's about my mom and my dad.

1073
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:42,330
Yeah, she told me.

1074
00:47:42,372 --> 00:47:43,772
She thinks I'm how you
found out she killed him,

1075
00:47:43,814 --> 00:47:46,094
but I had no idea.

1076
00:47:46,136 --> 00:47:48,138
Shit's so fucked up.

1077
00:47:49,459 --> 00:47:50,579
I know.

1078
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:51,980
But look, 'Riq,

1079
00:47:52,022 --> 00:47:54,262
I gotta get out,
but she'll never let me leave.

1080
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:56,464
She's fucking crazy,
and honestly, I'm scared.

1081
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,426
Yeah, I feel you.

1082
00:47:58,468 --> 00:48:00,709
I mean, can you believe
she sent Tommy after my mother?

1083
00:48:00,751 --> 00:48:02,711
Is she okay?

1084
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:04,472
She's fine.

1085
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,034
Tommy said they hashed it out.

1086
00:48:06,076 --> 00:48:07,435
If she went after your mom
like that,

1087
00:48:07,477 --> 00:48:08,757
how is Monet still alive?

1088
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:09,798
That don't make sense.

1089
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,479
Look, because my mom

1090
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:12,641
is still alive, all right?

1091
00:48:12,683 --> 00:48:14,482
And that's a win for me.

1092
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:16,765
I don't need no fucking war
between me and your family, D.

1093
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:18,687
That's just gonna end up
with my family

1094
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,328
having to go
on the fucking run again.

1095
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:23,251
Fucking Monet.

1096
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:25,295
Fuck.

1097
00:48:27,497 --> 00:48:29,698
Okay, look.

1098
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,259
What if it didn't start a war?

1099
00:48:32,422 --> 00:48:33,902
How is that gonna happen?

1100
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:35,704
Dru hates her,
and I want her ass dead

1101
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:38,146
for what she did to my father.

1102
00:48:38,188 --> 00:48:40,829
It's time for Monet to go.

1103
00:48:40,871 --> 00:48:42,190
I mean, do you really think

1104
00:48:42,232 --> 00:48:44,352
you can ever be free
while she's still alive?

1105
00:48:44,394 --> 00:48:46,234
She sent someone
to kill your mother.

1106
00:48:46,276 --> 00:48:47,555
You think she won't do that
again?

1107
00:48:47,597 --> 00:48:48,837
D, what are you asking me
right now?

1108
00:48:48,879 --> 00:48:50,759
I'm asking you to help me.

1109
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:52,080
What about Cane?

1110
00:48:52,122 --> 00:48:53,481
Cane will never know.

1111
00:48:53,523 --> 00:48:54,482
But we gotta move fast.

1112
00:48:54,524 --> 00:48:55,964
We only get one shot.

1113
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:00,929
All right, I'm in.
What do we do?

1114
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:03,331
She's been trying to get me
to come over and talk.

1115
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:05,013
<i>I'll pick her up</i>
<i>from the house</i>

1116
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:06,494
<i>and tell her Dru's waiting</i>
<i>at the penthouse</i>

1117
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:08,496
<i>to hash things out.</i>

1118
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:11,339
<i>I'll pull up right</i>
<i>to where you'll be hiding.</i>

1119
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,382
<i>Put two through the window</i>
<i>and drive off.</i>

1120
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:17,505
<i>I'll tell Dru and Cane</i>
<i>I never saw the killer's face.</i>

1121
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,190
So you ain't got nothing to say
until we meet up with Dru?

1122
00:49:27,637 --> 00:49:28,997
<i>This is some bullshit.</i>

1123
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,198
You out here causing drama
when it's finally

1124
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,359
your turn to step up
for this family.

1125
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,560
Family?

1126
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:34,202
This ain't a fucking family,
Monet.

1127
00:49:34,244 --> 00:49:35,684
This is a business.

1128
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,085
You killed our father.

1129
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:38,727
What kind of mother does that
to her children?

1130
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:42,090
You're right, D. You're right.

1131
00:49:42,132 --> 00:49:44,292
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

1132
00:49:45,655 --> 00:49:46,855
When I had to give Zeke up,

1133
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:49,537
it took something out of me.

1134
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:52,060
I couldn't be soft on you kids.

1135
00:49:54,384 --> 00:49:55,784
Dealing was Lorenzo's hustle.

1136
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,106
We raised y'all like soldiers,

1137
00:49:58,148 --> 00:49:59,908
and it was easier
to see you that way.

1138
00:50:01,471 --> 00:50:03,111
Easier to protect you
from the fucked up way

1139
00:50:03,153 --> 00:50:05,273
these streets treat you.

1140
00:50:05,315 --> 00:50:08,877
Now, I know that's not right,
D, but that's who we were.

1141
00:50:08,919 --> 00:50:10,318
Now, you put all this on me,

1142
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,681
but what about Lorenzo's hand
in raising you?

1143
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:15,884
He chose this life for us,
not me.

1144
00:50:15,926 --> 00:50:17,686
I'm tough on y'all.

1145
00:50:17,728 --> 00:50:21,489
Especially you,
because I love you.

1146
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,013
And I'm sorry.

1147
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,696
I don't know any other way
to show it.

1148
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,861
You still ain't got nothing
to say?

1149
00:50:32,903 --> 00:50:34,703
Ma, I left something
in the house.

1150
00:50:34,745 --> 00:50:35,744
Let- let's go back inside--

1151
00:50:38,228 --> 00:50:39,507
Ahh!

1152
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,879
Ma.

1153
00:50:57,047 --> 00:50:59,247
<i>Ma. Diana.</i>

1154
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:04,412
Oh, fuck.

1155
00:51:13,663 --> 00:51:17,105
She's still in surgery.
She's in critical condition.

1156
00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:20,470
I wish I had better news,
but uh, it's touch and go.

1157
00:51:23,994 --> 00:51:26,276
She sacrificed herself
to save me.

1158
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:37,007
Did you see who did this?

1159
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,489
It was Tariq.

1160
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,292
<i>Tariq?</i>

1161
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:47,335
He thinks Monet sent Tommy
after his mom.

1162
00:51:47,377 --> 00:51:49,577
He's looking for payback.

1163
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:51,259
I'm gonna kill him.

1164
00:51:51,301 --> 00:51:54,142
Cane, we don't even know
if Ma is gonna be okay.

1165
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:56,384
Cane, you can't--
we have to stick together.

1166
00:51:56,426 --> 00:51:57,465
You hear me?

1167
00:51:57,507 --> 00:51:58,987
I'ma kill him.

1168
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:00,508
Tariq gotta go.

1169
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,439
Ma, you took our father
from us!

1170
00:52:11,481 --> 00:52:12,520
You killed him!

1171
00:52:12,562 --> 00:52:14,002
Get the fuck off her.

1172
00:52:14,044 --> 00:52:16,084
Don't you ever put your
fucking hands on me again.

1173
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:17,285
Cane!

1174
00:52:19,129 --> 00:52:20,048
Yo, yo, wait, wait.

1175
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,850
Hold up. Hold up.

1176
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:23,291
She killed our father.

1177
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:24,853
She can't get away with that.

1178
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:27,495
She put Gordo up to it
and had me kill him.

1179
00:52:27,537 --> 00:52:29,898
It's either her or us.

1180
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,260
We gotta cover our tracks
if we gonna do this.

1181
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:34,582
Then we do exactly
what Monet did to Papi.

1182
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:36,184
We can't do it ourselves.

1183
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:38,506
We use Tariq.

1184
00:52:38,548 --> 00:52:40,348
There's no way
Tariq gets out of this alive.

1185
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,789
You know Cane will want blood.

1186
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:44,392
-So be it.
-What? No.

1187
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:45,713
-That doesn't sound--
-Diana, we are fighting

1188
00:52:45,755 --> 00:52:47,235
for our fucking lives.

1189
00:52:47,277 --> 00:52:48,837
Tariq kills Monet.

1190
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:51,399
Cane kills Tariq.

1191
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:53,641
What the fuck, Diana?

1192
00:52:53,683 --> 00:52:55,523
You were supposed to hit
'Riq's car

1193
00:52:55,565 --> 00:52:58,446
so Cane could take him out
right there.

1194
00:52:58,488 --> 00:53:01,449
I don't know
if Tariq is the shooter.

1195
00:53:01,491 --> 00:53:03,691
Someone else fucked up
the plan, Dru.

1196
00:53:03,733 --> 00:53:05,093
I don't know who.

1197
00:53:06,696 --> 00:53:08,616
<i>Tariq ain't stupid, Dru.</i>

1198
00:53:08,658 --> 00:53:10,418
Just gotta motivate him.

1199
00:53:11,581 --> 00:53:12,540
I still have that letter

1200
00:53:12,582 --> 00:53:13,741
that Saxe sent Monet.

1201
00:53:13,783 --> 00:53:15,263
<i>We can use that.</i>

1202
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:23,431
You can't serve me.

1203
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:25,233
You didn't even ask
my fucking name.

1204
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:26,514
Scram.

1205
00:53:26,556 --> 00:53:27,635
Tell Tommy this is a gift

1206
00:53:27,677 --> 00:53:29,237
from Monet Tejada.

1207
00:53:33,523 --> 00:53:35,443
- <i>We stick to our story.</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

1208
00:53:35,485 --> 00:53:37,725
-I don't--
-We stick to our fucking story.

1209
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,647
It was Tariq.

1210
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:51,099
<i>Ma, I'm so glad you called.</i>

1211
00:53:51,141 --> 00:53:53,982
Tommy told you
not to go after her, Tariq.

1212
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:55,383
What were you doing there?

1213
00:53:55,425 --> 00:53:56,704
Listen, Ma.
Diana was in on it, okay?

1214
00:53:56,746 --> 00:53:58,106
There wasn't gonna be
any retaliation.

1215
00:53:58,148 --> 00:54:00,428
Monet was my mark. Not yours.

1216
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:01,629
I'm your mother. I protect you.

1217
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,790
Oh, that's why
you knocked me out.

1218
00:54:02,832 --> 00:54:04,834
Hell, yeah,
and I'd do it again.

1219
00:54:05,635 --> 00:54:07,155
Listen.

1220
00:54:07,197 --> 00:54:10,198
Even if Monet survives,
your hands are clean.

1221
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,960
I mean, I'm going back
to Yas and Big Mama.

1222
00:54:12,002 --> 00:54:13,801
You are going back to school.

1223
00:54:13,843 --> 00:54:16,244
You get your trust,
and then you get out, baby.

1224
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,288
Then we can all be together
again.

1225
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,849
Ma, I fucked up.

1226
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,893
What you mean?

1227
00:54:26,376 --> 00:54:27,375
My- my trust fund is gone,
all right?

1228
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:29,297
<i>I lost it in a Ponzi scheme.</i>

1229
00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:31,419
What the--boy!

1230
00:54:31,461 --> 00:54:33,463
W- was it that Weston shit?

1231
00:54:34,224 --> 00:54:35,263
Damn, 'Riq.

1232
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,544
What now?

1233
00:54:36,586 --> 00:54:37,946
I don't know.

1234
00:54:37,988 --> 00:54:39,827
I mean, I thought
I was only escaping Noma.

1235
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:42,110
Wait, who the fuck is Noma?

1236
00:54:42,152 --> 00:54:44,072
All right, Noma
is Mecca's boss, all right?

1237
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,433
She found out
Mecca was killed.

1238
00:54:45,475 --> 00:54:47,075
She came here
looking for Mecca's killers,

1239
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,876
and now we've been trying
to fill in his role ever since.

1240
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:50,878
Or you pay with your life.

1241
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,880
Tariq, what have you
gotten yourself into?

1242
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,842
I mean, it's nothing
I can't figure out.

1243
00:54:54,884 --> 00:54:56,804
Look, I just need money.
You know? That power.

1244
00:54:56,846 --> 00:54:58,526
That power that makes you
literally untouchable.

1245
00:54:58,568 --> 00:54:59,847
That shit that Noma has.

1246
00:54:59,889 --> 00:55:01,929
Your dad tried that,

1247
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:03,451
and it took him down.

1248
00:55:03,493 --> 00:55:05,133
Yeah, but you know he didn't
do that shit right, Ma.

1249
00:55:05,175 --> 00:55:07,095
No, no, no.
Ghost was a lot of things,

1250
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,456
but he wasn't stupid.

1251
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,859
All right, but I learned
from his mistakes, all right?

1252
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:13,061
They're lessons for me.

1253
00:55:16,106 --> 00:55:18,506
All right. There's a way.

1254
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,668
But if you take it,
you cannot stop.

1255
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:22,110
You understand?

1256
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,152
With Monet shot,
it's a power vacuum.

1257
00:55:24,194 --> 00:55:25,393
I cleared the way.

1258
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:27,035
You just need to use it

1259
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:28,676
to get close to Noma
and try to--

1260
00:55:28,718 --> 00:55:30,518
Learn everything she knows

1261
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,080
so I can end up taking
everything she has

1262
00:55:32,122 --> 00:55:33,241
and bringing you home.

1263
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:35,403
But it's a dangerous play,
baby.

1264
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:37,285
You gotta be careful.

1265
00:55:37,327 --> 00:55:40,728
Yeah, I know,
but I'm not gonna get you back

1266
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,970
and have a life worth living
without taking a risk.

1267
00:55:43,012 --> 00:55:45,093
You know?

1268
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:47,375
'Riq, come on.

1269
00:55:52,502 --> 00:55:54,502
Just be careful, please.

1270
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:58,866
I got this, Ma.

1271
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,270
I hope so.

1272
00:56:05,315 --> 00:56:06,834
I hope so.

1273
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:14,882
<i>Junior.</i>

1274
00:56:14,924 --> 00:56:16,926
<i>Mom?</i>

1275
00:56:18,768 --> 00:56:20,528
What are you--
what are you doing here?

1276
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,530
You haven't been home.

1277
00:56:22,572 --> 00:56:24,011
Sorry.

1278
00:56:24,053 --> 00:56:26,654
Uh, our witness recanted,
and the case blew up.

1279
00:56:26,696 --> 00:56:29,097
I'm sorry.

1280
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:30,298
But you're still young,

1281
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,500
and it'll only make you
stronger.

1282
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,142
You've heard me say it before,

1283
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:37,065
but I am so proud that you
followed in Angela's footsteps.

1284
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:38,346
Yeah, I know.

1285
00:56:38,388 --> 00:56:40,948
And Angela
would be proud too.

1286
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:44,712
Um, this uh, came for you
in the mail.

1287
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,877
It's from that lawyer,
Cooper Saxe.

1288
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,571
And then there was one.

1289
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:05,012
Arms up.

1290
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:06,894
It's in my waist.

1291
00:57:06,936 --> 00:57:08,376
Mm.

1292
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:11,299
I see we are all being
more cautious these days.

1293
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:13,060
Follow me.

1294
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:23,391
Obi says you have
a proposition.

1295
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:25,473
Yes, I do.

1296
00:57:25,515 --> 00:57:27,955
I wanna work alongside you
so I can elevate.

1297
00:57:27,997 --> 00:57:30,438
Once you guys expand,
I can run shit right here.

1298
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,800
Bold of you to make demands
after a hit on Monet.

1299
00:57:32,842 --> 00:57:36,043
I hear whoever it was
didn't finish the job.

1300
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,605
Did you have anything
to do with it?

1301
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:39,687
Nah, that wasn't me.

1302
00:57:39,729 --> 00:57:41,969
There seem to be differing
opinions on the matter.

1303
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:43,571
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1304
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:49,497
Thought you got away with it,
motherfucker?

1305
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,579
- With what?
<i>- Diana saw you, Tariq.</i>

1306
00:57:51,621 --> 00:57:53,741
You tried to kill our mother.

1307
00:57:53,783 --> 00:57:54,822
D, what the fuck
are they talking about?

1308
00:57:54,864 --> 00:57:55,783
Tell them what happened.

1309
00:57:55,825 --> 00:57:56,904
You almost killed me too.

1310
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,831
-Anya Covington.
-Wait, Cane.

1311
00:58:03,873 --> 00:58:05,233
Tariq, what did you just say?

1312
00:58:05,275 --> 00:58:06,674
Anya Covington.

1313
00:58:06,716 --> 00:58:08,035
Yes, your daughter.

1314
00:58:08,077 --> 00:58:09,437
I got people with eyes on her.

1315
00:58:09,479 --> 00:58:11,399
<i>I promise you</i>
<i>if anything happens to me</i>

1316
00:58:11,441 --> 00:58:13,161
<i>or my family ever,</i>

1317
00:58:13,203 --> 00:58:15,283
I'll send them people
right after your daughter.

1318
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,484
Clever boy.

1319
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,326
Never without a plan, are you?

1320
00:58:18,368 --> 00:58:21,329
But perhaps you've flown
too close to the sun, love.

1321
00:58:21,371 --> 00:58:22,810
<i>Yo, what the fuck,</i>
<i>Effie?</i>

1322
00:58:22,852 --> 00:58:24,572
-I'm so sorry, Tariq.
-What the fuck did you do?

1323
00:58:24,614 --> 00:58:26,534
I told Noma that you were
threatening her daughter.

1324
00:58:26,576 --> 00:58:28,656
<i>We're working together,</i>
<i>and I have a future with her,</i>

1325
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:30,218
so I couldn't let that happen.

1326
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,459
This bitch.

1327
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:32,660
Now thanks to Effie,

1328
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:34,021
I've moved my daughter
to safety.

1329
00:58:36,025 --> 00:58:38,105
I've been wanting to do this
for a long time.

1330
00:58:43,913 --> 00:58:45,393
Get your ass down!

1331
00:59:02,932 --> 00:59:05,413
I think I took one
of those fuckers out!

1332
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,059
Yo, B, what the fuck?
How did you know?

1333
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:13,541
Obi called me.

1334
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,583
He said he owed you.
Something about green cards.

1335
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,024
He said they were gonna
fucking clip you.

1336
00:59:17,066 --> 00:59:18,426
I thought you was out, man.

1337
00:59:18,468 --> 00:59:19,427
Nah, I couldn't leave you
hanging like that.

1338
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:20,468
Are you fucking kidding me?

1339
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:21,909
What do we do now?

1340
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:24,552
Man, I don't know.

1341
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,434
I think we just started
a fucking war, though.
